<h2>Sudoku as a Prevention Against Dementia</h2>
<p>Keeping the mind active is one of the most important ways to promote long-term brain health.</p>

<p>Sudoku challenges the brain with logic-based problem solving, which stimulates neural activity. This mental exercise helps maintain cognitive functions such as memory, reasoning, and attention.</p>

<p>Some studies suggest that people who regularly engage in puzzles like Sudoku may have a reduced risk of cognitive decline as they age.</p>

<p>While Sudoku is not a cure or guaranteed prevention, it is a fun and healthy habit that supports mental agility and alertness.</p>

<p>Make it part of your routineâ€”not just for entertainment, but for lifelong brain health.</p>
