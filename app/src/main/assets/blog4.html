<h2>How to Solve Sudoku Effectively</h2>
<p>Solving Sudoku puzzles efficiently is all about strategy and patience.</p>

<p><strong>1. Start with the easiest numbers:</strong> Look for rows, columns, or 3x3 boxes with the most clues and fill in the obvious numbers first.</p>

<p><strong>2. Use pencil marks:</strong> Mark possible numbers in empty cells to keep track of candidates without guessing.</p>

<p><strong>3. Scan systematically:</strong> Check rows, columns, and boxes repeatedly to eliminate impossible numbers and narrow down options.</p>

<p><strong>4. Be patient and avoid guessing:</strong> Logical deduction is the key. Guessing can lead to mistakes and frustration.</p>

<p>With practice, your solving skills and speed will improve, making Sudoku even more enjoyable!</p>
