<h2>Sudoku History</h2>
<p>Sudoku may be most associated with Japan, but its roots go back much further and farther away.</p>

<p>The puzzle’s origins can be traced to 18th-century Switzerland, where mathematician Leonhard Euler developed a concept called "Latin Squares"—a grid-based logic pattern that inspired modern Sudoku.</p>

<p>The puzzle we recognize today was first published in an American magazine in the late 1970s under the name "Number Place."</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the mid-1980s that Sudoku truly gained popularity, thanks to Japanese publisher Nikoli, who gave it the name “Sudoku,” meaning “single number.”</p>

<p>Since then, it has become a global phenomenon, appearing in newspapers, apps, and puzzle books around the world.</p>
