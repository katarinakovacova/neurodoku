<h2>Why Did I Create My Sudoku Project?</h2>
<p>This project started as a way for me to learn programming. I wanted a simple, meaningful goal—and Sudoku felt like the perfect fit.</p>

<p>But it’s also deeply personal. Dementia has affected someone close in my family, and I’ve seen how important mental stimulation can be.</p>

<p>I’ve been solving Sudoku puzzles for many years. It was my mom who first introduced me to them, and it quickly became a part of my life.</p>

<p>By creating this app, I wanted to combine learning with purpose—offering something helpful to others while honoring a connection that means a lot to me.</p>
